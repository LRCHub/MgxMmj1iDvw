I love the lighthouse keeper
But he was taken by the waves
I love the railroad ranger
He was lost under the train so

All is lost, all in love is lost
And somehow this curse came down
On my house to take you away
Oh Saint, oh Saint, please save
His name I'll whisper here
Oh Grave, oh Grave don't take
Stay shut for one more year

Mind is a gate in way to heaven
Speak to me in slight and tongue
All I want for you is heaven
You my last and shining one

I love the fire man
But he was lost into the flames
I loved the lion tamer
But I left him in his cage

All is lost, all in love is lost
And somehow this curse came down
On my house to take you away
Oh Saint, oh Saint, please save
His name I'll whisper here
Oh Grave, oh Grave don't take
Stay shut for one more year

Mind is a gate in way to heaven
Speak to me in slight and tongue
All I want for you is heaven
You my last and shining one

Mind is a gate in way to heaven
Speak to me in slight and tongue
All I want for you is heaven
You my last and shining one
