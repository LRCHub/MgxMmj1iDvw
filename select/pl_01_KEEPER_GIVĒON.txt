Talking through your mom again
Put this pride aside again
I don't even know what time it is
Is it even worth a try
Tell me and I
Couple things I can't defend
I'm just trying to clean
my hands of all that I've done
Going green every time
I send don't it?
This type of night,
I need you right here
It's getting hard for me to say
The thoughts of me
in your apartment linger
Getting harder to replace you
Can't forget the way
that I remember
Ooh the way your lips
Reminiscing about the tenderness
When my days, turn to night
I get to missing you
I'm telling you baby
I can't be what I'm not
But you gonna be the one
to change me
I know that I'm enough
but I'm just trying to be
The one that you keep
Not just the one
who comes back around
And drives you crazy, I swear
Back around again
Most nights had truth in it
Break curfew like a kid
I dry my fingertips
Every time I lift your chin
I'm trying to defend myself,
all the times I was a man
The crying breaks the win
And this the night
I need you here
It's getting hard for me to say
The thoughts me
in your apartment linger
Getting harder to replace you
Can't forget the way
that I remember
Ooh the way your lips
Reminiscing about the tenderness
When my days, turn to night
I get to missing you
I'm telling you baby
I can't be what I'm not
But you gonna be the one
to change me
I know that I'm enough
but I'm just trying to be
The one that you keep
Not just the one
who comes back around
And drives you crazy, I swear
Back around again
Can you hear me when I say,
I just wanna be more
